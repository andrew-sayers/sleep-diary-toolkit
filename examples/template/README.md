# Sleep Diary Toolkit - Tool Template

## Releasing your tool publicly

Most tools are only developed for your personal use.  But here are some steps you should take if you want to make your project public:

1. replace all the template comments (like `{Name}`) with a proper value
2. choose a license and follow the license's instructions for applying it
3. replace this README with a detailed description of what your tool does

It might help to look at other tools to see how they did it.

## License

Because this repository is a flexible template for creating tools, it is released under the most permissive license available.  You should change this to a more appropriate license if you release your code publicly.
